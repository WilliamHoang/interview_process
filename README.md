#Common Mistakes

>Interviewing is an art form and there are common mistakes to avoid to ensure
>that you convey the best of your abilities and skills to the interviewer.
>Below are common mistakes to try avoiding during the interview process. 

###Immediately jumping into coding:
  - [1] Interviewer have no idea if you are going down a dead end or not
  - [2] Interviewer may not be able to offer advice or hints if you get stuck early on
  - [3] You will waste time if you decide to start over and take a new approach
  - [4] Potentially unfinished / incorrect code is all the interviewer will have to evaluate

###Not Running Through an Example:
  - [1] **DO** pick a simple example
  - [2] **DO** think about an edge case or two
  - [3] **DO** be clear with your example input.  Being overly specific is better than vague.
  - [4] **DON'T** waste too much time running through many examples

###Not writing real code:
  - [1] Use pseudocode to help formulate and communicate your initial idea and solution
  - [2] **DO** ask if helper functions can be used
  - [3] **DO** have discussion with interviewer on what can be used
  - [4] **DON'T** mix real code and pseudocode in solution

###Force-fitting solution to a similar but different problem:
  - [1] **DO** draw from experience and practice problems
  - [2] **DON'T** assume anything
  - [3] **DO** ask questions about the problem similarities 
  - [4] **DON'T** memorize the answer of problems and then force it into a solution

###Getting stuck on optimization before any coding:
  - [1] **DO** think critically about the algorithmic complexity of your solution
  - [2] **DON'T** assume brute-force is unacceptable
  - [3] **DO** explain why you think it is or isn't possible to improve complexity
  - [4] **DO** analyze and be able to explain algorithmic complexity of own code
