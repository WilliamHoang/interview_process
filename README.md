#Communications and Presentation 

>Keep these points in mind when interviewing always

###Verbalize your thoughts:
  - [1] Think out loud and show your work
  - [2] Draw pictures to help visualize your solution, especially for graphcs
  - [3] If you prefer to think in silence, make sure you verbally summarize.
  - [4] Ask for help if you are really stuck 

###Listen to the Interviewers:
  - [1] They are trying to help you and not out to get you
  - [2] Treat sessions as a "discussion" and not an "interview"
  - [3] Are they giving you meaningful hints? 
  - [4] Understand the question and re-phrase if needed
