#Algorithms 

>These are the mind frame of the algorithm questions to have

###Problems:
  - [1] How would you sort / search / represent / solve ... ?
  - [2] What is the efficiency of this data structure / algorithm ?

###Approaches:
  - [1] Listen carefully to the problem
  - [2] If a simple, "stupid", brute force solution immediately comes to mind, say it!
  - [3] Ask questions and consider alternative approaches  
  - [4] Recognize when two problems are similar
  - [5] Recognize and understand when HINTS are provided
